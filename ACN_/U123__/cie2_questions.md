# Unit 3 Questions

## Mobile IP - Introduction, Mobility, Routing and Addressing

**Q51.** Assume a mobile node is configured with an IP 15.7.7.1 from the subnet 15.7.7.X and is currently associated with a router having the IP 15.7.20.7 in 15.7.20.X subnet. Find i)Home Agent IP ii)Mobile Node IP iii) Foreign Agent IP iv) Care of Address v) Co-locate COA (5 marks)

**Q52.** To provide mobility to the devices, discuss the characteristics that should be possessed by Mobile IP which is a solution to the limitation of conventional IP (5 marks)

**Q60.** With a Proper scenario explain the limitation of conventional IP for Mobility (5 marks)

**Q61.** Discuss the different characteristics of Mobile Ip. (5 marks)

## Mobile IP Characteristics and Overview of Operations

**Q53.** A Correspondent Node with an IP 192.7.7.1 needs to communicate with the mobile node with IP 130.103.202.200 which is currently associated with a foreign agent having IP 130.111.111.111. A router with an IP 130.103.202.50 in the Home network of mobile node is acting as home agent. For this scenario demonstrate how the data is communicated between CN and MN(specify all 3 paths) (10 marks)

**Q57.** "When a host from home network needs to communicate with mobile node in foreign network the Proxy ARP concept is used". Say True or False and justify your answer (5 marks)

## Mobile Addressing Details

**Q62.** Explain the following Mobile IP entities i)Mobile Node ii) Home Network iii) Home Agent iv) Foreign Network v) Foreign Agent (5 marks)

**Q63.** Explain the following Mobile IP entities i)Correspondent Node ii) Primary/Home address iii) Secondary / Care of Address (3 marks)

**Q58.** Differentiate between Foreign agent COA and Co-located COA (5 marks)

**Q64.** Give the comparison between Foreign Agent COA and Co-located COA (5 marks)

## Foreign Agent Discovery

**Q55.** If a mobile node moves from its home network to a foreign network, discuss how mobile node gets its COA in foreign network. (5 marks)

**Q65.** Discuss the purpose and method of Agent discovery process in mobile IP (8 marks)

**Q66.** What is the need of Mobility Agent Extension message in Agent discovery process (5 marks)

**Q67.** With neat diagram explain the format of Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension Message (10 marks)

**Q68.** Assume the mobile node is requesting for registration but the agent busy to accept and the agent is willing to work as foreign agent. Configure this scenario in AEM message (5 marks)

## Agent Registration and Registration Message Format

**Q56.** A Node with IP 18.7.7.1 moves from its network to a foreign network with subnet 18.7.20.X. In foreign network router with IP 18.7.20.7 is acting as FA and a router with IP 18.7.7.20 is acting as HA in its home network. Demonstrate the steps that happen before data communication happens between the nodes (needs to specify the database contents at HA and FA). (10 marks)

**Q69.** With neat diagram discuss the process Agent Registration in mobile IP operation (10 marks)

**Q70.** With neat diagram discuss the role of each field in Agent registration Message format (10 marks)

## Communication with Foreign Agent, Datagram Transmission and Reception, Two-Crossing Problem

**Q71.** "Two-Crossing problem raises in Mobile IP when the mobile node uses home address for communication when it is in foreign network" Justify the statement with proper scenario (10 marks)
